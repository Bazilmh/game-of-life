JOHN CONWAYS GAME OF LIFE
-------------------------

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

ABOUT THIS PROGRAM
------------------

This program is a attempt to bring the game of life to a simulation environment by using SDL. The game consists of just a window of 640px x 480px dimensions. Simulation can be started by pressing 's' and can be paused by pressing 'p'. A glider can be inserted on the simulation grid by pressing 'g'. A reversed glider can be placed by pressing 'r'. Clicking anywhere on the plane will create a live cell at that point.

HOW TO PLAY
-----------

The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a cellular automation.  It consists of a grid of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.

You can play this game by first placing a certain configuration of cells and then running the simulation to see how it evolves. Its kind of interesting to see the evolution.
